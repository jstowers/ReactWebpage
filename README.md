# ReactWebpage
An updated webpage using React 16 and Webpack 3

### December 9, 2017
I tried to update an existing repository, but so many dependencies were outdated that I thought a blank canvas would provide a fresh start.

Goals:
-  Update my webpage
-  Add a cog animation
-  Deploy to AWS

Basic Webpage Setup:
1. Copy index.html template
2. Copy index.js React/Redux template
3. Update package.json with dependencies
    npm install
    - react (16.2.0)
    - react-dom (16.2.0)
    - react-redux (5.0.6)
    - redux (3.7.2)
4. Update package.json with devDependencies 
    npm install --save-dev 
    - babel-core (6.26.0)
    - babel-loader (7.1.2)
    - babel-preset-env (1.6.1)
    - redux-devtools (3.4.1)
    - webpack (3.10.0)
    - webpack-dev-server (2.9.7)
4. Install dependencies using npm install
5. Start webpack dev server
6. Render "Hello, World"
